# A-Parallel-Hybrid-Model-For-5G-Network-Congestion-Control-Based-On-Using-Machine-Learning-Approach
A hybrid machine learning system that predicts network congestion in 5G environments using combined supervised and unsupervised learning. The project analyzes traffic patterns, detects anomalies, and forecasts congestion to help improve QoS, network reliability, and decision-making.
